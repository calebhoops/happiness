    <h2>What Makes me Happy?</h2>
    <p>
      Let me first start off by defining what happiness is: happiness is when you have that good feeling inside, most often while you are doing something you enfoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that makes me happy is playing basketball. Weither it be alone, or with some friends at the gym, I enjoy it. 
      Another thing that brings me happiness next to basketball is skateboarding, it seems to bring peace of mind while I do it.

        Quotes From the Book
      </h2>
      <p>“what do you think? Have we made any progress? Have we reached our goals?”
           Siddhartha and Govinda are talking. Govinda is asking Siddhartha about their journey and how far they have come.
In our quest for happiness or just life in general, we tend to question a lot of things, especially things like: are we on the right path? Which way is the right way? 
</p>
	
      <p>“I cannot tell you the ‘rest’, O friend. You will learn it.” (p. 57)
	Siddhartha has asked the ferryman how he can get enlightened, and the Ferryman responds by telling Siddhartha that he cannot find happiness for him.
People can only help us find happiness to a certain extent. After that is all up to us to find happiness.
</p>
      <p>“When all the Self was conquered and dead, when all passions and desires were silent, then the last must awaken, the innermost of Being that is no longer Self - the great secret" (11)!
Siddhartha is talking to himself about being enlightened.
The goal of  getting enlightened is to free the soul from the body. Siddhartha has finally reached enlightenment.
</p>
      <p>The river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth...in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere, and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past, nor the shadow of the future...Siddhartha the boy, Siddhartha the mature man and Siddhartha the old man [are] only separated by shadows, not through reality...Nothing was, nothing will be, everything has reality and presence." Chapter 9, pg. 87
The ferryman is talking to Siddhartha about the river.
This quote shows the meaning of the river, the meaning of the river is life. Life is everywhere, all the time without a trace of past or hint of future.
</p>
      <p>"Had not his father suffered the same pain that he was now suffering for his son? Had not his father died long ago, alone, without having seen his son again? Did not he expect the same fate? Was it not a comedy, a strange and stupid thing, this repetition, this course of events in a fateful circle?" (107)
The narrator is talking about what had become of Siddhartha’s father.
Everybody dies, it is the harsh reality of life. In the case of where Siddhartha lives, he believes in reincarnation, so life and death are a never ending circle of pain.
</p>
      <p>"He saw all these forms and faces in a thousand relationships to each other, all helping each other, loving, hating, destroying each other and become newly born. Each one of them was mortal, a passionate, painful example of all that was transitory. Yet none of them died, they only changed, were always reborn, continually had a new face: only time stood between one face and another." (121)
Govinda is looking at Siddhartha right after he has been enlightened.
What govinda is seeing is the entire cycle of life Siddhartha has been through up to this point. Since Siddhartha is enlightened, he is free from this cycle.
